# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in TypeScript. It demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and basic object-oriented principles.

## Features

This TypeScript-based Library Management System (LMS) offers a streamlined approach to handling library operations. It features a structured representation of books, distinguishing between fiction and non-fiction categories, and maintains essential details such as title, author, and ISBN. The system enables members to borrow and return books, with functionalities to track and list borrowed items. Additionally, the libraryâ€™s collection can be efficiently managed through functionalities that allow for adding new books and displaying the current inventory. This project serves as a practical introduction to TypeScript, emphasizing object-oriented programming principles and effective data management within a library context.
